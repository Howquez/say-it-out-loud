    You are randomly matched with another participant, who also participates in the study right now.
    You can decide how many of your {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to transfer to this person.
    Doing so, you can choose any amount between 0 and {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}. The other person,
    receives the amount that you decide to transfer while you receive the amount that you decide not to transfer
    (and thus to keep).

    Please note that your decision has an actual impact: Both you and the other person will be paid according
    to your choice.

    You will use your microphone to record your decision. To this end, you will see buttons that enable you to start, stop
    and submit your recording. In addition, you will see a fill-in-the-gap-text. Use it to communicate your decision.
    Note that you can withdraw your recording and start a new one before you submit. You cannot
    listen to your recording, though.

    Please make sure that one can understand your decision loud and clearly, while you confirm that you have read and
    understand the instructions.
