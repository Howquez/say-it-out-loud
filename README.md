# Say it out loud 📢

This project contains a dictator game where participants receive an endowment and can decide whether and how much the 
want to donate to some charity.

Importantly, participants encounter one of two interfaces to communicate their decision: They either type their decision 
using a classic text input or they make a voice recording that the experimenters analyze using a speech-to-text engine. 
Which type of interface a participant encounters is determined randomly.

## 🚏 How you can access a demo
You can find the experiment's [Demo here](https://ibt-hsg.herokuapp.com/). A click on the app called _Charity_ 
creates a session and redirects you to a page containing several URLs. 
Click on the _Session-wide demo link_ to open the experiment.
