# Scope

This project introduces voice interfaces to economic experiments. So far,
we implemented and tested a dictator game.

To this end, we designed an 
online experiment using oTree. The experiment consists of a one-shot 
dictator game with a USD 2 endowment as well as multiple screens eliciting
self-reports to inform potential mediators, moderators and control variables
for future follow-up experiments. 

We piloted the experiment with about 500 participants recruited via Prolific.

# Content

Consequently, this repository contains 

1. [the software required to run the experiment](https://github.com/Howquez/say-it-out-loud/tree/main/econGames) (python, js and HTML), 
2. [scripts to analyze the corresponding data](https://github.com/Howquez/say-it-out-loud/tree/main/analyses/pre-registered) (R, Rmd and quarto),
3. [and some documentation to guide you through the data](https://github.com/Howquez/say-it-out-loud/tree/main/data).

# Versions

So fare, we ran one pilot in two iterations. I created snapshots (i.e. branches)
of the respective work progress at both points in time. You can find them
[here](https://github.com/Howquez/say-it-out-loud/tree/Dez.-2022-Pilot) and [here](https://github.com/Howquez/say-it-out-loud/tree/Nov.-2022-Pilot).
