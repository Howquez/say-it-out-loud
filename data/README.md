This sub-directory contains raw data (stored in `raw` and `page_times`) as well as processed data (stored in `processed`,
`payments` and `wav`). While most of this is rather self-explanatory, I briefly explain the wav folder and why it is not 
considered raw data: The experiment records some of the participants' voice. These recordings are converted to long 
`base64` strings, which you can find in the raw data. Subsequently, these base64 strings are converted to wav files 
(and stored in the corresponding folder), before they are passed to Google's Speech-to-Text API.


# Code Book
To better understand the data, this document provides code books for variables with different purposes. Importantly,
variables' naming corresponds to the processed data, where I removed information about otree scopes and round numbers.

The raw data's naming therefore differs slightly but you should be able to translate them easily. Also note, that 
the raw data contains more variables than the processed data.

## Mediator Variables

Batteries were displayed on separate pages in the order presented below. It was not possible to browse backwards. The order of items was 
randomized on each page. Hence, participants have been exposed to the _empathy_ questions (in some order) before they
saw the _image_ questions.

## Moderator Variables

Just as for the mediators, the batteries were displayed on separate pages. On each page, the order of items was randomized.
In addition, the sequence of pages was randomized as well. Hence, _greed avoidance_ questions may have appeared before 
_equity_ questions for some participants but afterwards for others
