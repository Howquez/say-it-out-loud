This task is about dividing money between yourself and another person to whom you are randomly
matched. You do not know this other person and you will not knowingly meet him/her.

You have been randomly assigned the role of the “allocator”. The other person is in the role of the
“recipient”.

You are endowed with 10€, the recipient is endowed with 0€.
You can decide how much of your 10€ endowment to transfer to the recipient. You can choose any
amount between 0€ and 10€. The recipient receives the amount that you decide to transfer to
him/her; you receive the amount that you decide not to transfer and thus to keep.
How much of your 10€ endowment do you want to transfer to the recipient?
