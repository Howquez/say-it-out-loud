You have been randomly assigned the role of the <b>Recipient</b>. The other person is in the role of the
allocator.
<br> <br>
You are endowed with nothing, the allocator is endowed with {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}.
<br> <br>
The allocator can decide how much of his/her {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to transfer to you. The allocator can
choose any amount between 0 and {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}. You receive the amount the allocator decides to transfer
to you while the allocator receives the amount he/she decides not to transfer and thus to keep.
<br> <br>
You do not make any decision. You simply receive the amount the allocator transferred to you.
